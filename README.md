Our UVC app is written for iOS using Swift 4.2, utilizing WKWebView to display a web version of our site. Certain changes to said webView keep the content nice and clean :D

## How Build

Clone GitHub repo and open .xcodeproj in Xcode (Xcode 10 required)

⚠️ Certain dependencies are required

## App Size

Since the app is only a few webViews and a couple of images, the app size is REALLY small. We like apps with a small footprint!

## Feedback

If you have issues with our app, simply open a “Issue” on GitHub. Otherwise feel free to reach out via [E-Mail](mailto:plugmeintezz@gmail.com) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/plugmeintezz).
